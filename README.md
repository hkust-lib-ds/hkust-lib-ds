## HKUST Library - Digital Scholarship

Every year, we offer opportunities for undergraduate students to develop digital projects where they can explore the state-of-art technologies, apply their skills and expertise through hands-on experience in practical scenarios. 

Through project-based work, students have the chance to gain experience in **digital scholarship** through a combination of professional mentorship and self-directed exploration of digital tools and methods. They can enhance their skills in practical scenarios and showcase their projects to the public.

Here, we also open-source the source code of each of these **DS CoLab projects**. We hope that by sharing them, we can inspire others to explore similar initiatives and contribute to the growing digital scholarship community.
